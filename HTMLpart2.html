<p>Lists are used to create a set of a data one after the other.<br>
There are two types of lists
<ol>
	<li>Ordered List</li>
	<li>Unordered List</li>
</ol>
Ordered List has a sequence in the bullets whereas unordered list doesn't.<br>
List of courses for second sem:
<UL>
	<LI>Algebra</LI>
	<li>Differential Equation</li>
	<li>Sanskrit</li>
	<li>Digital Fabrication</li>
</UL></p>
Definition list don't have bullets for their data, instead they have deeper indents.
Eg.
<dl>
	<dt>HTML</dt>
	<dd>Most Basic LaNGUAGE</dd>
	<dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
	<dt>CSS</dt>
	<dd>Right next to HTML</dd>
	<dd>Client Side Scripting</dd>
</dl>
Nested Lists are created by creating a list inside a list. They can have any combination of OL and UL.
Tables can also be created in HTML, 'table' tag is used.
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="border-collapse: collapse;"> <!-- border needs to be specified to have a grid -->
	<tr> <!-- <tr> tag is used to add the rows of the table -->
		<th>Course Name</th> <!-- <th> tag is used for column headings -->
		<th>Course Code</th>
		<th>Segments</th>
		<th>Credits</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sanskrit</td>
		<td>CA1048</td>
		<td>12</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Elementary Linear Algebra</td>
		<td>MA1140</td>
		<td>12</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Chemical Thermodynamics</td>
		<td>CH1140</td>
		<td>16</td>
		<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Differential Equations</td>
		<td>MA1150</td>
		<td>34</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
</table> <!-- cellpadding is the extra space around the content in the cell. 
		 cell spacing is the space between two adjacent cells -->
Colspan and rowspan is used when the range of a row or column is greater than a single unit.
